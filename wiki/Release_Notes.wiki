== Introduction ==

This page contains release notes for Tungsten Replicator open source releases.

  * TUC-249 - Replicator consistency checks fail with NullPointerException when replicator is offline
  * TUC-266 - Parallel apply performance is unexpectedly slow when using direct pipeline
  * TUC-267 - Tungsten Replicator tasks improperly commit current block on interruption, which causes a restart failure
  * TUC-268 - race condition with DDL immediately after Tungsten starts
  * TUC-269 - Possible loop with multi-master topology due to block commit
  * TUC-270 - Simple SQL sequence causes UNKNOWN shards
  * TUC-271 - Tungsten 2.0 installation does not work properly for off-board replication

== Tungsten Replicator 2.0.2 ==

This release is our first full open source release and contains a couple of critical bug fixes for parallel and multi-master replication as well as a number of smaller fixes to correct problems with installations.  Logs and other data structures are backwards-compatible with version 2.0.1.

Issue 2 - Configure script does not set up disk log

Issue 3 - Integrate Hudson build number to release tarball

Issue 5 - Replicator does not correctly assign #UNKNOWN shard when updates cross schema boundaries within a single transaction

Issue 6 - When using disk logs, thl list can show a NullPointerException error    

Issue 11 - Add a timestamp column into trep_commit_seqno table in order to know when this table was updated

Issue 15 - Some records get lost in multiple master replication    

Issue 19 - Thl unable to read disk log

Issue 20 - Need installation support for direct pipeline where master is on a remote host
