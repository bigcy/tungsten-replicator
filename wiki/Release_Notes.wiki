== Tungsten Replicator 2.0.6 ==

This release includes the first working implementation of batch loading for data warehouses, focusing on Vertica.  It also includes substantial improvements to parallel replication including fixes for bugs that caused replicator freezes as well as problems with serialization in large data sets.  There are minor improvements to enhance multi-master replication as well as a number of general fixes that improve performance and robustness of the replicator as a whole, especially when processing large transactions.  Finally, this release adds support for MySQL to Oracle as well as MySQL to PostgreSQL replication.  

You should be able to upgrade from Tungsten Replicator 2.0.5 using the tools/update command.  See the official documentation at https://docs.continuent.com/wiki/display/TEDOC/Tungsten+Documentation+Home, for instructions on upgrade.  Starting with this and future releases, replicator documentation is shifting to a new home on the Continuent website.  It is our goal to provide very complete documentation of replicator operation.

== Tungsten Replicator 2.0.5 ==

This release improves overall replication capabilities by fixing a number of bugs that affected stability of replication in production environments and increases robustness of parallel replication, which now clocks in at 4-5 times MySQL native replication performance.  It also includes robust installation commands for MongoDB and Oracle slaves.  There is a working prefetch applier available.  Finally, a draft batch load capability is available.  (See Issue 238 for more information; Vertica will be fully supported in the next replicator release.) 

Unlike previous releases there should be minimal issues with upgrade.  Tungsten 2.0.5 should be fully interoperable with Tungsten 2.0.4.  Note that there may be occasional changes in options used by tungsten-installer. Check 'tungsten-installer --help-all -a' for currently supported settings.

== Tungsten Replicator 2.0.4 ==

This release contains greatly improved parallel replication capabilities including high-performance on-disk queues, a production quality single-command install, and new features to support multi-master replication using the system-of-record model.  In addition, there are numerous bug fixes.  

This release requires careful attention to upgrade due to the following changes: 

 # *Installation procedures* have changed substantially.  The old tungsten.cfg is not compatible with the new tungsten.cfg file format, which is JSON-based. The new installation uses *./tools/tungsten-installer*, which is also a validation tool.
 # Installing a direct slave (useful for parallel replication) is simpler and straightforward. Taking over from MySQL native replication and handing back over to the old slave is also easy. 
 # The *trep_commit_seqno* table includes additional columns.  The table can be upgraded by running {{{ALTER TABLE `trep_commit_seqno` ADD COLUMN `shard_id` VARCHAR(128) NULL DEFAULT NULL; ALTER TABLE `trep_commit_seqno` ADD COLUMN `extract_timestamp` TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL;}}}
 # There is a new *trep_shard* table that can be created by running {{{CREATE TABLE `trep_shard` ( `name` varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', `master` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL, `critical` tinyint(4) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`name`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8}}}
 # The replicator logs are now integrated by a *user.log*, a more concise and user friendly log.
 # The installation tools can handle all values in the properties file. In addition to being a single-command installation, the procedure can also customize the replicator properties from the start.

Logs and other data structures should be backwards compatible.  However, due to the nature of these changes we recommend for the safest upgrade that you stop traffic on the master server, quiesce replication fully, delete existing THL logs as well as tungsten_svcname databases, then restart with new version 2.0.4 installations.  

The change in installations is a one-time occurrence that is necessary to provide better installation procedures that are fully scriptable.
