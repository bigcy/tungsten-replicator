*Important Note:*
Due to copyright issues, it is currently not possible for anyone-else than Continuent staff to build the replicator. We are working on this - stay tuned!

Here are the steps to build the replicator:
 * `svn co http://tungsten-replicator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/builder`
 * `cd builder`
 * `./build.sh`

This will create a `../sources` directory where all required components will be checked-out and build

If you want to modify directories, URLs, skip the checkout, compilation or source generation, it is strongly discouraged to edit `config` directly. Rather create a `config.local` file (it is already in svn:ignore) and override flags there.
Example:
{{{
# cat config.local
SKIP_CHECKOUT=1
SKIP_BUILD=0
SKIP_SOURCE=0
}}}
